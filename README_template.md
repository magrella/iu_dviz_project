- On Windows `cmd.exe` will not *expand* `presentation/*.py` into a list of files. You will have to expand the list of apps manually

```bash

For years, Python lagged behind other languages when it came to building interactive web applications. Python now has at least four full-featured, solid frameworks focused on dashboards and similar apps: Dash, Panel, Streamlit, and Voila+IPyWidgets. We'll hear presentations from proponents of each library, and then have a spirited debate and discussion: Which one is best for which purpose?
