#  ðŸ“‰ Uncovering Production Decline Characteristics of Oil Wells

This repository contains code and other material submitted as part of the Data Visualization course at ![IU](https://github.com/magrella/iu_dviz_project/blob/main/assets/logos/Indiana_Hoosiers_logo.svg)

I used a wide array of visualization libraries within the Python ecosystem.

Due to the large number of wells, it isnâ€™t feasible to manually update the chart. Instead, we opted to build and interactive dashboard using the Panel library.

This methodology allows to feature engineer deline values that can be mmpaed in order to accomodate situations in which both time and location are important towards understanding the dataset.
